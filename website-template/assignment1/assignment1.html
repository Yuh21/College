 <p>Nostalgia for the Old Internet: The author reflects on the early days of the internet, particularly the Geocities era, and how it was a time of personal, amateur web creation. This period is contrasted with today's appdriven, corporate-controlled internet.
Technological Cannibalism: The essay discusses how modern tech companies capitalize on nostalgia for the old internet while simultaneously erasing its history. This is described as a form of "technological cannibalism."1
Loss of Personal Agency: The shift from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 is highlighted, emphasizing the loss of personal agency and creativity. The author laments the move from customizable, user-created content to standardized, corporate-controlled platforms.
Cultural and Class Divides: The essay also touches on the cultural and class divides that influenced the migration from platforms like Myspace to Facebook, noting how these shifts were driven by aspirations for social status and professional class alignment.</p>
